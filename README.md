This repository contains the code and dataset for the paper:

**"Predicting Sorption Behavior of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals via BERT and Artificial Neural Network"**

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` â†’ Colab notebooks for preprocessing, training, and evaluation  
- `data/` â†’ Dataset used in the study (`data.csv`)  
- `models/` â†’ Trained model weights (if shared)  
- `results/` â†’ Example outputs, figures, and evaluation metrics  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset includes molecular descriptors, SMILES representations, and measured sorption coefficients (log Kd) for veterinary pharmaceuticals.  
- File: `data/data.csv`  
- Columns:  
  - `Compound` â€“ compound name or ID  
  - `SMILES` â€“ molecular structure in SMILES notation  
  - `Descriptors` â€“ physicochemical descriptors (logP, pKa, MW, etc.)  
  - `Kd` â€“ experimental sorption coefficient (log Kd)
